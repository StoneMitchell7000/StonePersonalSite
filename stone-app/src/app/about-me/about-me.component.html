                Hi, I'm Stone. I'm a software engineer and recent graduate from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.
                Located in Tucson, Arizona, but looking to branch out and explore new locations for career
                opportunities.
                <br />
                <br />
                I took up web development early. Watching my dad develop his career in software inspired me to do the
                same.

                When I'm not busy, I really enjoy escaping the desert and hitting the snow. One of my favorite hobbies
                is
                snowboarding, usually up in Pinetop or Park City.
                <br />
                <br />
                Don't get me wrong, I love my home town, but the 100Â°F summers we get down here are not for the faint of
                heart.

                More than anything, I love hanging out with long-time friends. Whether its snowboarding, gaming, the
                gym, rock climbing, or the card game 'Magic the Gathering', I'm all for whatever brings the boys
                together.
                <br />
                <br />
                On the job, I'm always very serious about the task at hand, and getting the job done right. But when I'm
                with my boys, I'm easily the silliest one there.
